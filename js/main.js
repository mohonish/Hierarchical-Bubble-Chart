/*

Approach:
> Get Data as JSON object from external file.
> Create SVG
> Create nodes (nested) while traversing through the json data object.
> Position nodes in proximity based on parent-child relationship.
> (Probably need to take care of) Collision detection and avoidance.
> Draw lines from center of each circle, from parent to child only.

Notes:
> Depth of node in json object is tracked by d.depth method.
